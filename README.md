# Expresso ☕️

Expresso, our coffee machine simulator, is all about simplicity with a twist. It operates using everyday ingredients like coffee, milk, and disposable cups. If it's running low on any of these essentials, it'll shoot you a notification. Our device not only brews espresso but also whips up cappuccinos and lattes. And of course, quality comes at a price - coffee aficionados will be charged for their brew.
